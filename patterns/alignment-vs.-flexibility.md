# Alignment vs. Flexibility

## Choose flexibility

One benefit of having a Microfrontend architecture is that each team can decide what technologies they want to use.

#### Advantages / disadvantages

+ Team is happier because they can use the frameworks the know and love  
+ It it easier to adopt new technologies  
-  Knowhow can not be shared between teams  
-  More difficult to align, especially UI/UX

## Choose alignment

Microfrontend architecture can also be implemented with an aligned technology stack.

#### Advantages / disadvantages

+ Knowledge can be shared among teams  
+ UI library can be build with a specific technology  
- It is more difficult to adopt new technologies

## What to choose?

It is not black or white. You don't have to choose between alignment or flexibility. There are a 1000 thing were you can decide whether to be aligned or leave the decision to the team. 

For example a decision could be to write all the shared resources in a framework-independent way. The tech stack could be all React or Angular, but the UI Framework has to be implemented with Web Components. Or util libraries could be written in pure JavaScript.

At the end it is always good to think about how a decision affects the alignment vs. flexibility line.
